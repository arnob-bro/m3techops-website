('Mastering React Hooks', 'Web Development',
 'Deep dive into React hooks for building modern components.',
 '<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>React hooks have revolutionized how we write functional components. By leveraging hooks like useState, useEffect, and useContext, developers can create stateful logic without relying on class components.</p>

<h3>Understanding useState</h3>
<p>The useState hook allows you to maintain state inside a functional component. It simplifies component logic and improves readability.</p>

<h3>Effectful Logic with useEffect</h3>
<p>useEffect manages side effects such as data fetching, subscriptions, and DOM manipulation in React functional components.</p>

<h3>Custom Hooks</h3>
<p>By creating custom hooks, developers can encapsulate reusable logic and share it across components easily.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>React hooks offer a cleaner, more expressive approach to managing state and side effects, making functional components far more powerful.</p>',

('Node.js Authentication Best Practices', 'Web Development',
 'Learn how to secure your Node.js applications.',
 '<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Authentication and authorization are critical in modern web applications. Node.js provides multiple tools to secure APIs and manage user sessions.</p>

<h3>Using JWT Tokens</h3>
<p>JSON Web Tokens are widely used for stateless authentication. They are compact, secure, and easy to implement.</p>

<h3>Password Hashing</h3>
<p>Never store plain passwords. Use bcrypt or argon2 to hash and salt user passwords.</p>

<h3>OAuth2 and Social Logins</h3>
<p>For more advanced apps, implement OAuth2 protocols to allow secure logins via Google, Facebook, or GitHub.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Secure authentication is essential for user trust. Implementing best practices ensures your Node.js app remains safe from common threats.</p>',
